# Quizbook

## Description

Quizbook is a social media application that is themed around trivia questions.

### Background

In this project, we started with a lean, existing application as we worked 
to **improve and extend** it over a two week period. A significant part of 
this challenge was to familiarise yourself with the codebase we inherited. 
Another part of the challenge was working in separate frontend and backend 
teams writing different languages: **JavaScript (React)** and **Go**.

### Structure

This repo contains two applications:

- A frontend React App
- A backend api Go server

These two applications communicates through HTTP requests, passing JSON data  
between each other, and need to be run separately.

The libraries we added to the frontend React app are:
- `react-type-animation` for custom type animations
- `react-web-hooks` for simplifying React feature
- `zod` for input validation ( when logging in, creating a password etc.)

The libraries we added to the backend Go app are:
- `bcrypt` for password hashing in the database

Our database uses:
- `postgreSQL`

### Features

- Users can create an account and delete their own account
- Users can log in using an account and log out from an account
- Users can view and edit their profile, including uploading a new profile 
picture and editing their bio
- Users can view other users' accounts
- Users can create, view, update, and delete posts
- Users can like and unlike posts
- Users can create, view, and delete comments on posts
- Access tokens and token validation
- A seed file to populate the database with data that demonstrates all the features
- Frontend form submission validation (e.g. passwords, correctly filled posts etc.)
- Error handling
- Tests for both the frontend and backend applications

### Out of Scope Features

**Friends**
- Users can add other users as friends
- Users can accept/decline invites for friends
- Users can view their friend-list

**Quizes**
- Posts are entire quizzes instead of single question-answers
- Different question types (e.g. multiple choice, true/false, etc.)
- Users can tag quizzes (e.g. by topic, by question types, etc.)
- Users can vote on a scale for difficulty of quiz
- Users can rate a quiz on quality (out of 5 stars)
- Users can create collections of quizzes
- Liked quizzes will appear on your profile/shown on another webpage

**Searching and sorting posts**
- Search functionality for posts & users with different search parameters  
(by tag, by quality, by particular users etc.)
- Sorting by time posted (ascending/descending, quiz quality etc.)

**Styling and misc.**
- Optimising for use on a mobile device
- Accessibility features for people with disabilities
- Continuous scrolling on webpage
- Animated buttons
- Refining the UX/UI

### Documentation

[Documentation of our applications can be found here.](./docs)

There is documentation for both the [frontend](./docs/frontend_routes) and the [backend](./docs/api_routes),
as well as documentation for the starter codebase, and the overall application at the end of the project.

### Card wall

We developed this project with an **agile** workflow, working in week-long sprints and using  
a Trello board to track our tasks and help plan sprints.

## Installation

### Install Node.js

If you haven't already, make sure you have node and NVM installed.

1. Install Node Version Manager (NVM)
   ```
   brew install nvm
   ```
   Then follow the instructions to update your `~/.bash_profile`.
2. Open a new terminal
3. Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), (`20.5.0` at
   time of writing).
   ```
   nvm install 20
   ```

### Install Go

Follow the instructions here: https://go.dev/doc/install

### Set up the project

1. Fork this repository
2. Rename the fork
3. Clone the fork to their local machine
4. Install dependencies for both the `frontend` and `api` applications:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ../api
   go get .
   ```
5. Start Postgresql

   ```
   brew services start postgresql
   ```

6. Create your databases:
   ```
   createdb <DB_NAME>
   createdb <DB_NAME>_test
   ```

### Setting up environment variables.

We need to create two `.env` files, one in the frontend and one in the api.

#### Frontend

Create a file `frontend/.env` with the following contents:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:8082"
```

#### Backend

Create a file `api/.env` with the following contents:

```
POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://localhost:5432/<DB_NAME>"
JWT_SECRET="<secret>"
```
Be sure to include the name of the database you just set up at the end of the postgres url.

For an explanation of these environment variables, see the documentation.

### How to run the server and use the app

1. Start the server application (in the `api` directory) in dev mode:

```
; cd api
; go run main.go
```
To start the server application and seed the database at the same time:

```
; cd api
; go run main.go seed
```

2. Start the front end application (in the `frontend` directory)

In a new terminal session...

```
; cd frontend
; npm run dev
```

You should now be able to open your browser and go to the
`http://localhost:5173` to get to the homepage and start exploring the application.
